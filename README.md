# g35_lights

Code for my G35 light controller.  Note that much of this code blatently stolen from sowbug's library here -
https://github.com/sowbug/G35Arduino

The RFM12b radio transciever code (with some small mods) from https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM12B

These should really be forks of these projects but this was a hack job from a long time ago that I have never bothered to clean-up.
