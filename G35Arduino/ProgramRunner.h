// ProgramRunner manages a collection of LightPrograms.

// It gives the current program a slice of time to run, decides when it's
// time to switch to the next program, and asks the program_creator callback
// to give it the next program when it's time. In Arduino terms, it's what
// you want to call in your loop() method.
//
// switch_program() is public because the application might sometimes want
// to change programs more frequently, for example if you've implemented
// a remote control receiver.
